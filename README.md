# Purpose
Learn Android deeply while having fun.

# TODO
* RenderScript (hashes arrays, binary search)
* Save battle state between configuration changes
* Store user data on Firebase
* Tutorial screens
* Help section
* Randomize initial cell position in battle on ring
* Friendly fire and intersection of friendly cells
* Direction to nearest friend
* Different battle scenarios? Save VIP cell?
* Make limited count of hexes instead of money. Life hexes will be base ones. Available transformations:
  2 life -> 1 attack
  5 life -> 1 energy
  10 life -> 1 death ray
  Backward transformations are also available. In such case it's possible to forbid some transformations.
* Change edition screen. Pick and place different hexes whether from cell or from buckets.
  Pick by long press (only from cell?).

# Future features
* Multi-player
* Downloadable skins
