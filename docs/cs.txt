Gentlemen, if you do not stop drinking, you will die very soon.
Remember, the word "rum" and the word "death" mean the same thing to you.
Kittaro, Zoe! You have to hurry, the tension in the city is increasing.
Yes, how do everyone know that I need somewhere?
A couple of magic tricks, that's all.
Hello, Palmos.
Hello, Zoe.
Kittaro, meet the former court magician.
Yeah, you look unimportant. I see rumors are confirmed ...
What other rumors?
Too vague to draw any conclusions from them.
Well, in that case, let's go with us, such a magician like you would be useful to us.
I can not, I have too much to do, and there must be someone to keep order here!
I will go with them.
Ayma! It's too dangerous, I need you here!
I'm sure you will cope with everything yourself, besides you yourself said
that the appearance of the spirit is an event that occurs once in a lifetime and such an experience cannot be missed.
Yes, he said ...
Kittaro, meet my student Ayma.
You, Zoe, it makes no sense to represent her.
Not. Since I am a spirit, I am almost omnipresent, which means that I know a lot and I know many.
I remember her as a girl, in those days it was still possible to walk and collect petalubas without fear in my caves ...
Okay, okay, we know the story.
If the spirit does not stop in time, he will tell you his whole life, believe me.
Kittaro take these artifacts - these are Actinas, I have just three of them, Ayma will explain how to use them.
Actins are hexes that can be placed anywhere in the cell.
If two actin from friendly cells come together at a distance of 10 or less,
between them there is a beam, hitting enemies by 5 units.
